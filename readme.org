* Formal Systems in Biology

A collection of resources that apply formal systems to model biological processes.
Some easily accessible books to understand the general approach to this field might be:

McCullouch and Pitts study of neurons in biology birthed the pivotal paper that kickstarted A.I., [[https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM704.pdf][regular languages]], and digital computers. It was the only paper included in [[http://abelgo.cn/cs101/papers/Neumann.pdf][the EDVAC report]] by John Von Neumann.

An interactive demo of their model is available here: https://justinmeiners.github.io/neural-nets-sim/

* Further Research

Rashevsky devised the [[https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fjhbs.1094][primary model of neural networks]] which was interpreted using the boolean language by McCullough Pitts. His student Robert Rosen went on to work on using Category Theory to model biology. These works need to be catalogued here.
